## Chest Shops

### **About Chestshops**

Chestshops allow you to sell items to players or buy from them.

This guide will go through all the different types of chest shops you can setup, as well as all commands.

You can have multiple signs/shop types on a chest at the same time.

Each rank gives you access to create more chest shops, check `/warp ranks` for more information.
